    <h1>Defination of Cool</h1>
        <p>I'm a firm believer in the fact that every single one of us things that we are in fact "cool".
             I think, err,know , that I am cool because of the clothes that i wear, my hair is cool, 
             what i do is cool, how i do things, etc. Everything about me is sheer and utter coolness! 
             i live cool and i breathe cool. I even bleed cool. I'll bet that I am way cooler than you.
              How do i know this? Well, because i am cool. Simple. Right!</p>

    <h2 class="hot">Calculate Cool</h2>    
    <p>5% aspiration + 95% self-perception +10% public awareness + 46% individuality + 15% actions +22%
         verbal + 99% what others think about you. Wait, this doesn't add to 100%- but I guess that is 
         my point. Coolness doesn't add up to 100 either.</p>      
    
    <h2 class="hot">Ultimate Coolness</h2>   
    <p>Being as cool as I am, I am going to go on a limb('cause that's what coole people do ) 
        and give you my hypothesis of ultimate coolness. :Rest assured, the fact that I am stating my 
        opionon makes me genuinely cool,but i disgrass momentarily. there is no real tangible coolness.
         Coolness is the what you think it is. Being cool is how you perceive you world. it is all about 
         your perceptuon. Want to test your coolness(and my theory)? Just go ask someone if they think you 
         are cool. They will look at you kind of funny, quickly think about potentially losing coolness 
         by admitting to themselves that the person asking is, or could be cooler that the person beibg asked.
         And of course give your an answer -BUT, Probably indirectl;y, such as 'your socks or shirt is cool', 
         or the purgatory of coolness-'maybe', or 'depends'.</p>
